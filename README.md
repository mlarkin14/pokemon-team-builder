# pokemon-team-builder

## Description
Many people love playing pokemon with their fondest memories is playing the first in kanto. Since the beginning, pokemon has been about getting a team of pokemon to battle other trainers. Making a good team is very important as that could be the difference from victory or defeat. So we decided to make a pokemon web api to help make several times for different strategies. 

Our project uses a pokemon api to make teams of 6 pokemon from the original 151. 

We chose this as our project because of our shared memories of pokemon when we were younger.
